# Internship Code (February - August 2024)

This repository contains the code and resources I used during my internship from February to August 2024. Below are the key notebooks and files included:

## Notebooks

- **`Retrieve_gene_sequence_and_their_median_expression.ipynb`**: This notebook retrieves gene sequences along with their median expression levels and includes detailed source information.

- **`DNABERT_DExTER_dataset_constructions.ipynb`**: This notebook formats the data for input into DExTER or DNABERT-2 models.

## Files

- **`final_results`**: This file serves as the equivalent of the GTEx file for gene expression. Refer to the `Retrieve_gene_sequence_and_their_median_expression.ipynb` notebook for more details.

- **`dex_annotations_important.csv`**: This file is equivalent to `genomic.gff`.

## Documentation

- For detailed information about the DNABERT-2 and DExTER models, please refer to the `README.md` file. Note that for DExTER, the documentation is named `myreadme.md`.

## Additional Notebooks

- **`other_notebooks`**: These notebooks were used throughout my internship to obtain various results. You can understand the code by reviewing the titles of each code block.
